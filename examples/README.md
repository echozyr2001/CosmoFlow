# CosmoFlow Examples

This directory contains comprehensive examples demonstrating CosmoFlow's capabilities from basic concepts to advanced patterns. These examples are designed to provide a progressive learning path for understanding CosmoFlow workflows.

## ‚úÖ Available Examples

### 1. Hello World (`hello_world.rs`)

A simple greeting workflow that introduces fundamental CosmoFlow concepts with minimal code.

```bash
cd examples && cargo run --bin hello_world --features minimal
```

---

### 2. Custom Node (`custom_node.rs`)

An sophisticated iterative workflow demonstrating stateful nodes, data analysis, and report generation.

```bash
cd examples && cargo run --bin custom_node --features minimal
```

---

### 3. Flow Macro (`flow_macro.rs`)

Demonstrates the powerful `flow!` macro for declarative workflow construction with custom action routing.

```bash
cd examples && cargo run --bin flow_macro --features basic
```

**Syntax Example:**

```rust
let workflow = flow! {
    storage: SimpleStorage,
    start: "decision",
    nodes: {
        "decision" : DecisionNode,
        "success_path" : SuccessNode,
        "error_path" : ErrorNode,
        "final" : FinalNode,
    },
    routes: {
        "decision" - "default" => "success_path",
        "decision" - "error" => "error_path",
        "success_path" - "continue" => "final",
        "error_path" - "continue" => "final",
    }
};
```

## üîß Additional Examples

```bash
cargo run --bin unified_hello_world --features basic
cargo run --bin unified_counter --features basic  
```

## üèóÔ∏è Feature Levels

CosmoFlow provides different feature tiers to match various use cases:

| Feature Level | Description | Storage | Built-ins | Use Case |
|---------------|-------------|---------|-----------|----------|
| **minimal** | Core workflow functionality only | Custom only | None | Learning, custom implementations |
| **basic** | Adds memory storage backend | Custom + Memory | None | Development, testing |
| **standard** | Adds built-in node types | Custom + Memory | Basic nodes | Common workflows |
| **full** | Complete feature set | All backends | All nodes | Production applications |

## üìã Best Practices

### Node Implementation

1. **Three-Phase Pattern**:
   - `prep()`: Read and validate inputs, prepare resources
   - `exec()`: Perform core logic (keep stateless and idempotent when possible)
   - `post()`: Write outputs, update state, and determine next action

2. **Error Handling**:
   - Use appropriate error types for different failure modes
   - Implement retry logic for transient failures
   - Provide meaningful error messages and fallback behavior

3. **State Management**:
   - Use SharedStore for inter-node data communication
   - Keep node internal state minimal and recoverable
   - Consider persistence strategies for long-running workflows

### Flow Design

1. **Workflow Structure**:
   - Always validate flows before execution
   - Use meaningful and consistent node/action naming
   - Design and test all possible execution paths

2. **Performance Considerations**:
   - Set appropriate `max_steps` limits to prevent infinite loops
   - Consider cycle detection overhead for iterative workflows
   - Monitor execution metrics and optimize bottlenecks

3. **Maintainability**:
   - Document complex routing logic and business rules
   - Use consistent naming conventions across the project
   - Provide clear error messages and logging

## üéØ Next Steps

After working through these examples, consider:

1. **Explore Built-in Features**: Try the `standard` and `full` feature sets
2. **Build Custom Workflows**: Combine patterns from multiple examples
3. **Production Deployment**: Implement proper error handling and monitoring
4. **Advanced Storage**: Explore Redis, file-based, or custom storage backends
